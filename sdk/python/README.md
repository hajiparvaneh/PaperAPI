# PaperAPI Python SDK (Planned)

The Python SDK will provide first-class dataclass models and an async client on top of `httpx`. Until it lands, use the HTTP reference docs and the `.NET` SDK for the most up-to-date request/response schema. Contributions are welcome—see `docs/getting-started.md` for the release workflow.
