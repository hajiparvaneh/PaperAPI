# PaperAPI JavaScript SDK (Coming Soon)

This folder reserves the structure for the upcoming TypeScript implementation of the PaperAPI SDK. It will eventually ship as an npm package with typed models and fetch helpers. For now, reference the `.NET` SDK or the HTTP snippets in `docs/getting-started.md`.

Planned roadmap:
- Type-safe client built with `fetch` and `zod` validation.
- Bundled ESM/CJS artifacts published via GitHub Actions.
- Example Next.js project showing both server-side and edge usage.
